Introducing the Spartan 3E FPGA and VHDL
========================================

v0.42, 15 September 2012 :
Includes another batch of much-needed edits from LarryW, and a note about the numbering of LEDs and switches

[[dedication]]
Thanks to my wife Vivien for her support, and a special thanks to my young boy
Evan, as it was during his long afternoon naps when most of this was original written.

Thanks also go to Jack Gassett and the team at Gadget Factory for their support 
with this project, designing and manufacturing the LogicStart MegaWing. Peter Boxall
at Block Box Consulting also deservers a thank you for selling me my first FPGA board. 

Most probably, the people you will thank most, are Felix Vazquez and Larry Walewski for their help with editing-- we're only up to chapter 6 at the moment but we'll get there!
