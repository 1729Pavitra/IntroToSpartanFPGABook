Prerequisite skills
-------------------

Here is the skills that I think are required for somebody wanting to
learn to program FPGAs. None of these are essential, but I will assume
that you have them during this book, and won't bother delving into them.
If you are particularly week in any areas then be prepared to learn!

* Programming ability in a low level language (e.g. 'C' or assembler)

Do you know what a byte is, how many bits and what it can hold? What does
a bit shift two bits to the left do? What happens when you treat an unsigned
number as signed? Do you have any idea of the ASCII code for ''Z''?

* Familiarity with the basic boolean operations
