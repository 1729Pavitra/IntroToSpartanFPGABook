Installing the EDA tools
------------------------

The first step in using your FPGA is to install the tools required 
to implement your designs - these are collectively called "Electronic
Design Automation" (EDA) tools, but you can just as easily think of 
them as the VHDL IDE and compiler.

Acquiring the EDA software tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Xilinx design tools available for download from 
http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.htm. Be warned - it is a 
very, very big download. You want the package called "Full Installer 
for Windows" or "Full Installer for Linux" - one of the options
is to install only the "cut down" WebPack version.
 
* As Xilinx ship the Windows software in a "UNIX" tar.gz file, on Windows
you will need something like "7-zip" to extract the installer software. It can
be obtained from http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

* During the install you will need to register with Xilinx for a license
file. The software will help you acquire during the install. The
install process is very good at walking you through this, so don't fret over it.

* You will need the development board specific tools from the vendor to 
allow you to download designs to the board - for the Papilio you will
Papilio Loader from http://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.Download and for
the Basys2 you will need Adept 2 from http://www.digilentinc.com.

If you don't have a FPGA development board you are still able to work
your way through the modules, but it is not the same without seeing the
design run in actual hardware.

Setting up the software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unpack and install all the software - the downloading hurts far more than the
installing! If working on Linux search the web to find any missing 
dependencies - I have only used the Altera tools on Linux and it was quite a
challenge to get everything working correctly.
  
If you have Basys2 board you can play with the preloaded self-test application
that is loaded into your board - the Papilio One is shipped "empty".

Hints for Linux users

From Andrei Barbu: 

''Digilent's GUI tool seems to segfault quite a bit, at least under Gentoo.
The workaround is to use their command line tool which is nicer anyway since it can be scripted.''
