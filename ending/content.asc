Sorry! All finished! Apart from the advanced features of the I/O 
blocks (such as DDR2 inputs and outputs) you have pretty much played
with all the features of the Spartan 3E.

So if you are still keen to learn more:

* Have a read through the Xilinx AppNotes library. The ones on
creative uses of BRAM and MULT18s is full of good ideas

* Read through  full Spartan 3E User Guide - it will make some sense now

* Create a system using the PicoBlaze embedded processor

* Sell or gift your development board to a friend and move up to
one with off-chip RAM, ROM, DACs, ADCs, Ethernet...

* Try a different FPGA vendor's board - that will really make your head hurt

* Have a go at building something really nifty

If there is something I have missed or you want to say thanks send me an
email - or maybe send me a postcard to me at 370 Ellesmere Junction Road,
Springston 7616, Canterbury, New Zealand. It will be fun to see if I actually get any cards!
